# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. The client wanted us to develop a game that can be delivered across multiple OS to maximize the distribution of their product. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I demonstrated the ability to translate non-technical client requirements into technical development strategies. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found the design document a valuable tool to define the client requirements, to then determine the design constraints, and ultimately to provide the client feedback on how to best accomplish their request.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluation section. I would try to be more specific, and to explain how each operating system deployment would determine our strategy for developing our clients product. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
We determined our users needs in the Executive Summary - where we explained the goal - and the Design Contraints - where we determined the software requirements of our client and specified the design contraints based on those requests. It is important to consier the user's needs when designing an application, to ensure the usability and functionality of our design process provides utility to the client/end user.  

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The use of diagraming and pseudocode can be invaluable to translate design constraints into a code outline. Using generics to understand the strategies to build a functioning program can be an invaluable tool in visualizing the product. Using UML diagrams also provide a visualization of how various classes and resourcew will interact, to help develop a design strategy - as well as divide the labor involved in developing the product amongst various developers or teams.
